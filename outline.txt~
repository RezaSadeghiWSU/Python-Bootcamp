•         Why python

◦         free; portable; easy to learn; intuitive; rapid prototyping; quick to write small programs, but also possible to build large applications; reasonably efficient; numerous extensions (modules)

•         just a few things you can use python for

◦         converting or filtering files

◦         automating repetitive tasks

◦         computing statistics

◦         building processing pipelines

◦         implementing simple web applications

•         how to start interactive python session

•         assignment statements, showing simple math and how to print values

•         basic types including simple operations on them

◦         int, float, string

◦         lists

◦         dictionaries

•         how to run python scripts

•         control flow statements

◦         if

◦         for

◦         while

•         errors

•         functions

•         advanced python scripts

◦         importing other modules (your own and system)

◦         command line arguments

◦         “main routines”

•         Some useful idioms

◦         sorting

◦         splitting lines

◦         list comprehensions

•         working with files: open, close, readline, implicit readline,

•         putting it all together, an actual program that does something useful:

◦         read lines from file, process them, reformat and output, keeping statistics: sys.argv, open, read, split, dict, % formating, writing

 

•         another useful program

◦         create pipeline running various programs: subprocess, glob, logging, second module

•         how to debug programs (idle?)

•         Some features we didn't have time to explain but you should know about

◦         default and named function parameters

◦         garbage collection

◦         objects

◦         argparse

◦         tuples

•         Some modules you should know about

◦         glob, argparse, re, os

◦         struct, cPickle

◦         statistics (scipy?)

 

•         best practices

◦         logging

◦         assert

◦         small test inputs with known outputs

•         how to install python

•         common gotchas

◦         references

▪         copy list by doing a=b[:]

◦         convert string numbers to actual numbers int(“3”), float(“3.14”)
